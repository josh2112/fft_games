# TODO

- Medium and hard Fosteroes puzzles
- Bucket stats by time taken?
- Fix bug in generator -- 2026-01-25 easy is an unsolvable puzzle

- Figure out a way to set a max height on the Wordle grid for big client windows.
  `SizedBox(height: 450, child: Expanded(child: const BoardWidget()))` throws a Javascript
  error (only when deployed!) - some WASM bug.
